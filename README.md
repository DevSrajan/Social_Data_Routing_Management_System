# Social App Posts Management System

## Project Overview

The **Social App Posts Management System** is a Node.js-based application that allows users to interact with posts from a MongoDB database. The application fetches posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and saves them to the MongoDB database. It provides users with a simple interface to view, add, edit, and delete posts. The backend is powered by Express.js, and the front-end uses EJS for rendering views. MongoDB is used to store post data locally.

### Key Features:
- **Fetch Posts** from an external API and save them to MongoDB.
- **View All Posts** on a page with options to edit or delete.
- **Edit Post** functionality to update the title and description.
- **Add New Post** functionality to add a post to the database.
- **Validation**: Form validation for post title and description.
